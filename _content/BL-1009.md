**What Is a One-to-Many Relationship in a Database? An Explanation with Examples**

*One-to-many relationships are one of the most common database relationships. If you want to learn when and how to use one-to-many relationships, then this article is a great starting point.*

You will surely use one-to-many relationships to store information in any relational database, whether you are designing enterprise-level software or just creating a simple database to keep track of your uncle’s stamp collection.

## A Brief Introduction to the Relational Model {#-intro-model}

Relational databases are a core component of any modern transactional application. The relational model is composed of tables (data organized in rows and columns) that have at least one unique key that identifies each row. Each table represents an entity. This is shown in the following example, a very simple version of a table representing customer orders:

The above diagram, Each row in the table represents one order, and each column (also known as an *attribute*) represents each individual piece of information contained in an order.



## What Are Relationships and Why Do We Need Them? {#relationships-importance}

If we take a deeper look at the table used in the prior example, we will see that it does not really represent a complete order. It does not have all the information you would expect it to have. You will notice that it does not include any data related to the customer that made the order, nor does it have anything about the products or services ordered.

What should we do to complete this design to store order data? Should we add customer and product information to the **Order** table? That would require adding new columns (attributes) for customer names, tax identifiers, addresses, etc. as shown below:

If we do that, we’ll soon run into problems. Most customers place more than one order, so this system will store customer information many times, once for each order of each customer. That does not seem like a smart move.

Moreover, what happens when a customer changes their phone number? If someone needs to call the customer, they may find the old number on previous orders – unless someone updates hundreds (or even thousands) of existing orders with the new information. And the same would go for any other change.

A relational model requires us to define each entity as a separate table and establish relationships between them. Storing all the information in a single table just doesn’t work.

There are several types of relationships between tables, but probably the most common is the one-to-many relationship, which is often written as 1:N. This kind of relationship means that one row in a table (usually called  the parent table) can have a relationship with many rows in another table (usually called child table). Some common examples of one-to-many relationships are:

- A car maker makes many different models, but a particular car model is built only by a single car maker.
- One customer may make several purchases, but each purchase is made by a single customer.
- One company can have many phone numbers, but a phone number belongs to one company.
- 

Going back to our initial order example, the **`Customer`** table would be the parent table and the **`Order`** table the child; a customer can have many orders, while an order can belong to a single customer.

Please note that the one-to-many definition allows a row in the parent table to be associated to many rows on each child table, but it does not require it. Actually, the design allows a customer to have zero orders (i.e. a new customer who has not yet made their first purchase), one order (a relatively new customer who has made a single purchase) or many orders (a frequent customer).

## Showing One-to-Many Relationships in an ER Diagram {#one-to-many-diagram}

Let’s take a look at a more complete example of a simple customer ordering system using an ER (or entity relationship) diagram.

This is a more realistic design. You will notice that there are new entities (tables) in the diagram, which now contains the tables **`Customer`**, **`Order`, `Order Detail`**, and **`Product`**. However, the most important thing you notice is that there are now **relationships** **between the tables**.

In a database model, relationships are represented by lines connecting two entities. The characteristics of these relationships are represented by different connectors:

- When there is a single vertical line, the entity nearest that connector has only one row affected by the relationship. It’s the ‘one’ in one-to-many.
- When there is a multi-line connector that looks like a crow foot, the entity nearest that connector has multiple rows affected by the relationship; it’s the ‘many’.

Looking at the image and knowing the notation, it is simple to understand that the diagram defines that each Order can have many Order Details and that each Order Detail belongs to a single Order.
