## Version Control System {#Version-Control-System}

![What is VCS](/BL-1001/vcs.png)


A version control system (VCS) is a software tool that helps developers manage changes to their code over time. When working on a project, it's common for multiple developers to be making changes to the same codebase, and it can be difficult to keep track of who made what changes, when those changes were made, and why they were made. 

The most popular VCS is Git, which was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git works by tracking changes to files in a repository (a collection of files and directories), and creating a history of those changes. Each time a developer makes a change to a file, Git creates a new version of the file and records information about the change, such as who made the change, when it was made, and what was changed. This information is stored in a "commit", which is like a snapshot of the code at a specific point in time.


## What is git? {#What-is-git}

Git is a tool used to keep track of changes made to files and projects over time. It is commonly used by programmers to keep track of changes to code, but it can also be used for any type of files.

Git also makes it easy to collaborate with others on the same project. Everyone can work on their own version of the project and then merge their changes together to create a final version.

Git is often used in combination with online platforms like GitHub or GitLab, where you can store your code and collaborate with others. These platforms make it easy to share your work with others, keep track of changes, and work on projects with people from around the world.

## What Is GitHub? {#What-Is-GitHub}

GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets us manage Git repositories. It’s an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control projects outside of your local computer.
Other Git repository hosting services also exist: Eg:- GitLab, BitBucket, and SourceForge

GitHub just takes things a little bit further than Git, offering more functionality and resources, as well as a place online to store and collaborate on projects. And because GitHub is cloud-based, an individual’s Git repositories can be remotely accessed by any authorized person, from any computer, anywhere in the world.

Through GitHub, one can share code with others, giving them the power to make revisions or edits on your various Git branches. This makes it possible for entire teams to coordinate together on single projects in real-time. As changes are introduced, new branches are created, allowing the team to continue to revise the code without overwriting each other's work.
